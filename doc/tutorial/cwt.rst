B-splines
---------

A B-spline is an approximation of a continuous function over a finite-
domain in terms of B-spline coefficients and knot points. If the knot-
points are equally spaced with spacing :math:`\Delta x` , then the B-spline
approximation to a 1-dimensional function is the finite-basis expansion.

    \[ y\left(x\right)\approx\sum_{j}c_{j}\beta^{o}\left(\frac{x}{\Delta x}-j\right).\]
